        We can accept and fulfill the challenging jobs particularly in dairy segment.
        On-line milk procurement (i.e. Direct Interface of Weighing Scale and Eco-Milk to PC) will benefit in no-human
        errors & interfere. That will save lot of time with more accuracy.
        We have User Creation Facility .In this we have maintained full security at all user-levels. Authority to users
        can be set by the admin person depending upon designation of the user. The user can have Add, Modify and Delete
        options. All users must keep their user name and password confidential.

        We have a Multi-Company facility if all companies having same activities & nature of business. You can create
        any number of companies by your own. Easy Year-Ending process that will prepare new year database with current
        balances c/f within few seconds just by entering password. Easy Carry-Forward process that will calculate
        balances of last year accounts and will carry forward to current(New) year even after year ending.
        We have used Auto-Accounts Creation Concept at the time of creating new society account.
        That will create multiple sub accounts the time of creating a new society account. All accounts auto created
        like Advance A/c, Cattle feed A/c, etc. have their internal relationships and are inter-related. There are many
        Sub-Societies that are supplying milk under one society this relationship & concept is handled very carefully in
        this system till finalisations.
